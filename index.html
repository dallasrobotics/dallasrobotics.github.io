<p>XTL is a series of C++ template metaprogramming patterns, idioms, algorithms and libraries that solve a variety of programming tasks. XTL supplements and cooperates with the STL by providing some frequently used components that are otherwise absent from the standard. The library can be used out-of-the-box in many cases by simply including the desired header since most components are header-only. A few components require linking to a run-time component so they will need to be compiled. Also included are a number of tutorials on C++ template metaprogramming (TMP) that explains the various techniques used.</p>

<p>XTL is a public release of a much larger private repo which I've maintained over the years and the time has come to begin releasing it incrementally to the public as time permits. Components will be released in whole parts as time permits. Different quality standards exist exist between public and private code so will require CI integration, unit, integration and system tests, documentation, etc. It is my sincere desire to offer a valuable contribution to the open source communities which have handsomely blessed my bank account over the years with their public submissions.</p>
